To run the program with the training sets provided, load the code into an IDE such as eclipse and run the program.

To change the training sets, change the values being passed to the Neuron function starting at line 43.

The results can be graphed by plotting the values outputted by the print statements put after curRun is incimented (line 49). 
For example, if the values outputted were .8 and -.8, youd'd graph the points (0, 0), (-1, .8), and (1, .8).

To change the network structure, you'd need to modify how many calculations are done in Neruon, and training. You'd also need to add more
weights and activation variables at the beginnign of the code.
